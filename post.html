				<h2>lifeStyle</h2>
				<p>A lifestyle brand is a brand that attempts to embody the values, aspirations, interests, attitudes, or opinions of a group or a culture for marketing purposes.
                    Lifestyle brands seek to inspire, guide, and motivate people, with the goal of their products contributing to the definition of the consumer's way of life.
                     As such, they are closely associated with the advertising and other promotions used to gain mind share in their target market.
                    They often operate from an ideology, hoping to attract a relatively high number of people and ultimately become a recognised social phenomenon</p>

				<h2>KFC</h2>
				<p>KFC's original product is pressure fried chicken pieces, seasoned with Sanders' recipe of 11 herbs and spices. 
                    The constituents of the recipe are a trade secret. 
                    Larger portions of fried chicken are served in a cardboard "bucket", which has become a feature of the chain since it was first introduced by franchisee Pete Harman in 1957.
                     Since the early 1990s, KFC has expanded its menu to offer other chicken products such as chicken fillet sandwiches and wraps,
                      as well as salads and side dishes such as French fries and coleslaw, desserts and soft drinks; the latter often supplied by PepsiCo.
                     KFC is known for its slogans "It's Finger Lickin' Good!", "Nobody does chicken like KFC" and "So good".</p>
